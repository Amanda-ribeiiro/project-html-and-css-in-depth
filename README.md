## Features
- **Visual Layout:** I paid special attention to the visual layout of the project, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly structure. I utilized techniques such as proper spacing, harmonious colors, and legible typography to enhance the design.
- **Semantic Structure:** The project follows the best practices of HTML semantics, ensuring a well-organized and meaningful code structure. I used appropriate tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc., to provide a clear and meaningful structure for the content.
- **CSS Layout:** I utilized CSS to control the layout and appearance of the elements. Advanced techniques like flexbox and grid were implemented to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **CSS Styling:** The application of styles plays a crucial role in making the project visually appealing. I used CSS selectors to style various elements, defining colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual attributes. The goal was to create a cohesive and consistent style throughout the project.
- **CSS Effects:** To enhance interactivity and user experience, I implemented CSS effects such as transitions, animations, and transformations. These dynamic elements ensure an engaging and immersive experience for the users.
